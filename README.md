# 📸 Picify

**Picify** is a Pinterest-inspired image sharing app built with Node.js and Express. I developed this project as a practice exercise to improve my backend development skills. It's a minimal, functional clone where users can sign up, log in, upload pictures with captions, and view them in a clean, Pinterest-style feed layout.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** + **Express.js** — Backend and routing
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** — Database for storing users and posts
